Perform security audit of AWS infrastructure: {{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID or DOMAIN}}

Action plan:
1. Reconnaissance: identify S3 buckets, EC2 instances, public endpoints, enumerate services via DNS
2. S3 Security: test bucket permissions, public access, ACL misconfigurations, bucket policies
3. IAM Assessment: review roles, policies, check for overly permissive permissions, find unused credentials
4. EC2 Security: scan for open security groups, test instance metadata service (169.254.169.254), check IMDSv2
5. Network Security: review VPC configurations, security groups, NACLs, public subnets
6. Database Exposure: check RDS public accessibility, security groups, encryption settings
7. Lambda Functions: test for function URL exposure, environment variable leaks, IAM role permissions
8. CloudTrail & Logging: verify logging is enabled, check for security monitoring gaps
9. Report: prioritized cloud security findings with AWS-specific remediation steps
