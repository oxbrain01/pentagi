Conduct database security assessment: {{DATABASE_TYPE}} at {{HOST:PORT}}

Action plan:
1. Access Testing: test for default credentials, weak passwords, anonymous access
2. Network Exposure: verify database should not be internet-accessible, check firewall rules
3. Authentication: test authentication mechanisms, user enumeration, password policies
4. Authorization: review user permissions, test for privilege escalation, check for excessive grants
5. Injection Testing: SQL injection in application layer, test stored procedures for injection
6. Configuration Review: check for dangerous configuration options (xp_cmdshell, LOAD DATA, file_priv)
7. Encryption: verify data-at-rest encryption, SSL/TLS for connections, check for sensitive data in plaintext
8. Backup Security: test backup file access, check backup encryption, verify backup restoration procedures
9. Audit Logging: verify audit logs enabled, test log tampering, check retention policies
10. Report: database-specific security findings with hardening recommendations
