Assess DevOps infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline security: {{ORGANIZATION}}

Action plan:
1. Repository Security: scan GitHub/GitLab for exposed secrets, API keys, credentials in commit history
2. CI/CD Configuration: review Jenkins/GitLab CI/GitHub Actions configurations, test for injection in pipeline definitions
3. Container Security: scan Docker images for vulnerabilities, test for container escape, check image sources
4. Secrets Management: test secret storage (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), check for hardcoded secrets
5. Access Control: review permissions on repositories, pipeline access, deployment keys, service accounts
6. Artifact Security: scan build artifacts, test artifact repository access controls (Nexus, Artifactory)
7. Kubernetes Security: review pod security policies, RBAC, network policies, exposed dashboards
8. Infrastructure as Code: review Terraform/Ansible for misconfigurations, overly permissive IAM roles
9. Monitoring & Logging: verify security logging, test log tampering, check for security monitoring gaps
10. Report: DevOps security findings with secure pipeline recommendations
