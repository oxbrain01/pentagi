Perform external attack surface assessment for organization: {{ORGANIZATION_NAME or DOMAIN}}

Action plan:
1. Asset Discovery: enumerate all domains, subdomains (subfinder, amass), IP ranges, ASN information
2. Certificate Transparency: search crt.sh for subdomains, identify forgotten assets
3. Port Scanning: scan all discovered assets for open ports and services
4. Web Application Fingerprinting: identify technologies, CMS, frameworks, server versions
5. Email Security: test SPF, DKIM, DMARC records, email spoofing potential
6. Cloud Asset Discovery: search for exposed S3 buckets, Azure blobs, exposed cloud databases
7. Sensitive Data Exposure: search GitHub, GitLab, Pastebin for leaked credentials, API keys
8. Third-Party Integrations: identify SaaS applications, API endpoints, partner integrations
9. Vulnerability Prioritization: identify internet-facing critical vulnerabilities
10. Report: comprehensive external attack surface map with risk-prioritized findings
