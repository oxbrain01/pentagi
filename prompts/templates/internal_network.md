Conduct internal network penetration test from position: {{INITIAL_ACCESS_LEVEL}}

Action plan:
1. Network Reconnaissance: ARP scanning, identify network segments, map internal infrastructure
2. Service Discovery: comprehensive port scanning of internal hosts, identify critical servers
3. SMB/NetBIOS Enumeration: test null sessions, enumerate shares, check for anonymous access
4. Credential Attacks: LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning (Responder), relay attacks, password spraying
5. Vulnerability Exploitation: exploit unpatched services, test default credentials, known CVEs
6. Privilege Escalation: exploit local vulnerabilities, misconfigured services, weak permissions
7. Lateral Movement: pass-the-hash, token impersonation, exploit trust relationships
8. Data Exfiltration: identify sensitive data locations, test data loss prevention controls
9. Persistence: establish persistent access mechanisms
10. Report: document internal security posture, attack path visualization, remediation priorities
